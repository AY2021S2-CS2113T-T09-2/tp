## Overview
NUSMaze is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based application that aims to simplify NUS Computer Engineering studentsâ€™ journey from one point to another within the NUS Engineering and Computing buildings. 
The application allows users to find the shortest route from one block to another, locate the nearest eateries, tag personal notes to the location, add their daily scheduled routes and more. 
This application was created with the aim of helping NUS Computing and Engineering students reach their lessons in time and to aid in making their journey in NUS quicker and more enjoyable.
